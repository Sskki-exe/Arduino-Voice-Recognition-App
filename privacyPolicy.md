# Privacy Policy

Sskki (me) published Arduino Voice Recognition (my "app"). This page is a privacy policy that Google is now mandating from all their app publishers.    
    
My app does not and cannot collect any information. It's completely offline. By using my app, you agree to give up nothing, in accordance with this policy.

## Information Un-Collection And Disuse
While using my app, I ask that you have fun. Nothing is collected or used. I guess if you leave a review on the Play Store, I'd appreciate the feedback but I won't sell it to 3rd parties.
## Log Data
Nothing is logged. It's pretty scary how many companies log data, what data they log and how much. But as a person reading a privacy policy of an opensource app, I doubt I need to preach to you the importance of online privacy.    
    
Have a nice day!
